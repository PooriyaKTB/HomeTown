                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Pooriya</strong>, and I've spent nearly 30 years living in various neighborhoods across Tehran. 
                    Life in a city with four distinct seasons, where ancient history and modernity blend seamlessly, has been an incredible experience. 
                    From the majestic view of Mount Damavand and the serene Chitgar Lake to the traditional old houses and towering modern skyscrapers, 
                    from the vibrant and lively nights to the warmth of its kind-hearted people and the amazing food in its countless cool cafes and restaurants,
                     Tehran has left me with beautiful memories that I'll cherish forever.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Tehran, the capital of Iran and the heart of Tehran Province, is nestled in the north-central part of the country at the foot of the majestic Alborz mountain range.
                    Since Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty declared it the capital over 200 years ago, Tehran has transformed from a modest town into a sprawling metropolis,
                    now part of an urban region that houses nearly 14 million people. Its dramatic topography, 
                    with views of the towering Mount Damavand—the highest peak in Iran—serves as a natural backdrop that symbolizes Tehran's prominence as the country's gateway to the world. <br><br>
                    The city's modern identity took shape in the late 20th century, shaped in part by the Iranian Revolution of the late 1970s.
                    Global media at the time depicted Tehran as a deeply traditional, religious city, resisting the forces of modernization and Westernization. However, this portrayal only scratched the surface.
                    While Iran has a history that stretches back thousands of years, Tehran itself is relatively young in comparison. Much of the city's architecture and infrastructure was built after the mid-1960s,
                    and the average age of its population is just over 31, giving it a youthful, energetic character. <br><br>
                    Tehran's growth reflects a paradox: it challenges the image of Iran as a purely ancient land. While it preserves the legacy of Persian culture, it simultaneously embraces the pulse of modernity.
                    The city is the beating heart of Iran's vibrant and diverse cultural life. Tehran is home to a dynamic mix of both traditional and contemporary cultural expressions. Art galleries, museums, 
                    and theaters across the city showcase the works of contemporary Iranian artists alongside centuries-old Persian masterpieces. 
                    Places like the National Museum of Iran and the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art preserve this rich artistic history while reflecting the city's forward-looking attitude. <br><br>
                    In recent decades, Tehran has also become a stage for creativity and innovation. It hosts numerous festivals that celebrate film, music, and poetry, embodying the city's evolving cultural scene.
                    The contrast between Tehran's youthful energy and its historical roots makes it a unique cultural hub in the region—a place where the past and present intertwine,
                    constantly redefining the city's identity in the global sphere.
